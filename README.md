# js_memory_card_game
The purpose of this project was to reinforce what I've learned while learning Vanilla JavaScript. It's a simple memory card game in which the user has to find the matching colors. More specifically, this project involves working with arrays, functions, toggling html elements and other DOM manipulation.
